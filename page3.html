            <h1>It unites the world together</h1>
              <p>It is a sport that is played globally whether the ball that is used in soccer is replaced with a sock, a rock, a shoe, a football, and or a basketball etc. The concept of kicking a spherical object into a net remains the same for everybody, no matter what corner of the world you're from.</p>

            <h2>It helped me realize my passion</h2>
              <p>Through soccer i have been able to realize my passion and what really moves me. It has also strongly helped me decide what career I want to pursue and have. Due to what i consider my healthy obsession a day doesn't go by that I’m not watching a game or talking about it at the very least. I now aspire to become a sports journalist whether as an analyst on live tv or simply writing a recap for a game or an article on a player or team.</p>
            <h3>Stephen Talks Soccer</h3>
               <p>In addition to this it has inspired me to kickstart a soccer podcast which I plan on launching very soon. A podcast that revolves strictly around the soccer world.</p>
