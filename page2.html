            <h1> Early Career</h1>
            <p>My career as a footballer started when I joined the Gloucester Hornets in 2009 and according to the coaches there was an obvious gap in skill between myself and the other 9 yr olds and as a result they put me in a league with kids two years older than I was. That was only for one season however as the next year i played with my age group and some games with the age groups above mine.</p>

            <h2>Cumberland Cobras</h2> <p>I then made the decision to switch teams as i wanted to play at even more competitive level. I was given that opportunity with the Cumberland Cobras which is now known as OTFC (Ottawa-Toronto FC). I moved to the Cumberland Cobras when I was 12 years old. I played for the Cobras for nearly 6 years. I continued to play in my favourite position (left wing) and kept the jersey number #20 at both teams that I was at. The highlight of my time with the Cobras would be when my team and i competed in the Ontario Summer Games in 2016 as it was a tournament with a lot more prestige than I was accustomed to.</p>

             <h3>High School Soccer Experience</h3>
              
              <p>The last part of my playing career is me playing for both the futsal team in grades 7 and 8 and the school soccer team from grades 9-12.It was a very turbulent experience particularly in the beginning as I went from being one of the more mediocre players on the team to being the co-captain of a winning team in my penultimate year of high school. It was a bit surreal to me because my brother had also played on the team when he was in high school and I was eager to follow his footsteps.</p>
